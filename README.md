# Welcome!

## Introduction

[Link ](https://sop.mini.pw.edu.pl/en/sop1/)to the main course website.&#x20;

This website is intended to help better understand material covered by graded labs and prepare for them well.

The course is divided accordingly to the laboratories structure. The only prerequisite for this is C programming. Nevertheless, key C language features are presented since a further part of the course heavily relies on them.
